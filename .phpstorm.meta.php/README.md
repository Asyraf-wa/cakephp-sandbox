### IdeHelper meta file

See https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-ide-helper/blob/master/docs/Generator.md

We are not hiding this folder in this app for demo purposes.

Note: In normal apps there is no need to commit this file usually.
You can, but you can also generate this at runtime.
In that case add the folder/file to .gitignore :)
